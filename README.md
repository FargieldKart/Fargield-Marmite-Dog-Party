# Fargield-Party README

**Installation Instructions (Windows only for now)**

Download BepInEx 5.4.21 (do not download BepInEx 6, as the mod might not work) and choose either x64 or x86 based on your CPU's architecture: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21

If you don't know your CPU's architecture, I recommend downloading the x64 version as it's the standard architecture for most chips from Intel and AMD right now.

To locate your Garfield Lasagna Party game directory: Open Steam and go to the GLP page in your Steam library. Click on Manage (cog icon), Manage once more, and select 'Browse Local Files'.

Extract the three contents in BepInEx_x--_5.4.21.0.zip (winhttp.dll, doorstop_config, & BepInEx folder. You don't need changelog.txt) and move them to the 'Garfield Lasagna Party' game directory.

Move the plugins folder that's inside Fargield.Party.v0.1.ALPHA.by.ElectricYoshi to "Garfield Lasagna Party\BepInEx".

This mod version is kinda rushed and unfinished, but there will be better things to come soon... ^_^
